//----------- Ownership rules -----
// 1. Each value in Rust has a variable that's called its owner
// 2. There can only be one owner at a time.
// 3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

fn main() {
    // s is not valid here, it's not yet declared
    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point onwards
    // do stuff with s

    // takes_ownership(s);  // Ownership of `s` is moved to this function
    // println!("{}", s); // Error! `s` is no longer valid here

    let x = 5; // i32 is Copy, so itâ€™s okay to use it later
    makes_copy(x);
    println!("{}", x); // `x` can still be used here because i32 is a Copy type

    let s1 = gives_ownership(); // `s1` now owns the string
    println!("s1 = {}", s1);

    // println!("{}", s); // When you assign s to s2 in the if block, the ownership of s is potentially moved to s2. However, because the condition b is false, s is not moved, and the assignment doesn't happen. But Rust still assumes that s2 might take ownership of s, making s invalid after the if block.

    let mut x: Box<i32> = Box::new(1);
    let a: i32 = *x;         // *x reads the heap value, so a = 1
    *x += 1;                 // *x on the left-side modifies the heap value,
    //     so x points to the value 2

    let r1: &Box<i32> = &x;  // r1 points to x on the stack
    let b: i32 = **r1;       // two dereferences get us to the heap value
